# Hospital_Management_system_Data_Analysics
Analyzed a hospital management database using SQL to join 7 tables on patients, physicians, nurses, and diagnoses. Designed advanced queries, integrated with VS Code, and used Python for visualization, delivering key insights on disease trends, staffing, drug use, and high-cost procedures.

**Repository:** [Hospital_Management_system_Data_Analysics](https://github.com/DoaaHussein2025/Hospital_Management_system_Data_Analysics.git)  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing a **Hospital Management Database** consisting of 7 interconnected tables containing information on patients, physicians, nurses, diagnoses, and medical procedures.  

Using **SQL** for data extraction and **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** for visualization, the project transforms raw healthcare data into actionable insights that can improve hospital decision-making, resource allocation, and patient care.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Identify patterns in **disease prevalence** across genders.  
- Detect **drugs prescribed for multiple medical conditions**.  
- Determine **positions occupied by more than one physician**.  
- Highlight the **Top 10 most expensive medical procedures**.  
- Compare **primary check-up frequency** across staff positions.  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **SQL** – Complex queries, joins, filters, aggregations.  
- **Python** – Data analysis and visualization.  
- **Pandas** – DataFrame creation and manipulation.  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Visual analytics.  
- **VS Code** – SQL-Python integration.

## 📂 Database Structure  
The database contains the following tables:  
1. **Physician** – Doctor details.  
2. **Department** – Hospital departments.  
3. **Nurse** – Nurse profiles.  
4. **Patient** – Patient demographics.  
5. **Diagnosis** – Recorded diagnoses.  
6. **Procedures** – Medical interventions.  
7. **Patient Diagnosis** – Links patients to diagnoses.  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights  
- **Hypertension** is more common in males.  
- **Nurses** record the highest number of primary check-ups.  
- **Tramadol, Acetaminophen, and Fluoxetine** are prescribed for multiple conditions.  
- **Surgical attending physician** is the most common shared role.  
- **Fluoroscopy – upper GI series** is the most expensive procedure.
